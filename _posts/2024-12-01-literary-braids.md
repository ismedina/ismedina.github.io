This is a legacy post about a pet-project of mine called *Literary Braids*. It arose as a way of visualizing character interactions between characters in a literary work. Chracters are plotted as threads, which entangle and "braid" as the narrative progresses. For example, this is what *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* look like from this perspective: 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/alice.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Literary Braid for <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>.
</div>
