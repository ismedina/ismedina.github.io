I hold a BSc Mathematics and a BSc Physics from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, followed by a Master in Mathematics at TU München and a PhD in optimization and data science at [Uni Göttingen](https://ot.cs.uni-goettingen.de/). 

The topic of my PhD was optimal transport, an exciting area of research at the interface between optimization, data science and machine learning, dealing with defining and computing geometrically meaningful distances between probability distributions. This experience led to several relevant [publications](publications), as well as the Python libraries [`LogSinkhornGPU`](https://github.com/OTGroupGoe/LogSinkhornGPU) and [`DomainDecomposition`](https://github.com/OTGroupGoe/DomainDecomposition) for the solution of large optimal transport problems on grids using GPUs, enabling state-of-the-art speed and an easy interoperation with machine learning pipelines using PyTorch.

As part of my PhD I was a visiting scientist at TU München until February 2025.

My previous [working experience](cv/#work-1) comprises:

* A scientific traineeship at the European Commission's Joint Research Center, in Ispra, Italy. I focused on performance models for PV devices and applying data science and machine learning to geo-spatial PV data. 
* Contribution as a research assistant to the open source packages [`fermifab`](https://github.com/cmendl/fermifab), [`Qaintessent.jl`](https://github.com/Qaintum/Qaintessent.jl) and [`Qaintensor.jl`](https://github.com/Qaintum/Qaintensor.jl)
* Industrial experience at Siemens Corporate Technology, working on model order reduction and remaining lifetime estimation.
