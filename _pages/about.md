I hold a BSc Mathematics and a BSc Physics from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, followed by a Master in Mathematics at TU München. 
I am currently finishing my Ph.D. in optimization and data science at [Uni Göttingen](https://ot.cs.uni-goettingen.de/). My Ph.D. topic is optimal transport, an exciting area of research at the interface between optimization, data science and machine learning, dealing with defining and computing geometrically meaningful distances between probability distributions. I am visiting TU München until February 2025.

My previous experience comprises
* A scientific traineeship at the European Commission's Joint Research Center, in Ispra, Italy. I focused on performance models for PV devices and applying data science and machine learning to geo-spatial PV data. 
* Contribution as a research assistant to the open source packages Fermifab, Qaintessent.jl and Qaintensor.jl.
* Industrial experience at Siemens Corporate Technology, working on model order reduction and remaining lifetime estimation.
