I got Bachelors in Mathematics and Physics from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, followed by a Master in Mathematics at TU München. 
I am currently finishing my Ph.D. in optimization and data science at <a href='https://ot.cs.uni-goettingen.de/'>Uni Göttingen</a>. I am visiting TU München until February 2025.

I recently completed a scientific traineeship at the European Commission's Joint Research Center, in Ispra, Italy.
