title: I defended my PhD thesis! 
---

I defended my PhD thesis on 11.12.2024 at Uni Göttingen. I am deeply grateful for these four years at Uni Göttingen's [Optimal Transport group](https://ot.cs.uni-goettingen.de/index.html). My work with [Bernhard Schmitzer](https://ot.cs.uni-goettingen.de/schmitzer.html) and others led to several impactful [publications](/publications/) in the field of computational optimal transport.

My PhD thesis is available [here](http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?ediss-11858/15702).
