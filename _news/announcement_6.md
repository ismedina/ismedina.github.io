I will contribute my expertise in optimization and data science to [RIZM](https://www.rizm.de/)'s energy system simulation platform. RIZM is used by some of the largest industrial companies in Europe to plan their daily operation and future energy investments, optimizing synergies between renewables and production and aligning with Europe's decarbonization objectives. This new position aligns with my decision to orient my career towards the promotion of renewable energy, so I couldn't be more excited about the work ahead!
