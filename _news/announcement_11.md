Building on my stay at the JRC, Ana M. Martinez, Ewan Dunlop and I propose a flexible, future-proof, open-source climatic classification for photovoltaics (PV). 

⚡ We develop the first PV climatic classification addressing annual yield and performance ratio, with applications to resource allocation and energy rating.

🌤️ We acknowledge that annual averages of PV parameters are informative, but do not capture the full picture of PV performance. For this reason we also introduce a distribution-based classification that encapsulates the time-dependent variability of PV energy yield, giving insights into the potential for firm PV around the globe. 

💡 We employed the latest PV performance models to ensure relevance with current PV technologies.

🌍 We provide tailored global and pan-European classifications.

💻 We open-source the data and models for a fully reproducible and extendable classification. Check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/ismedina/climatic-zones-pv) and the [dataset at the JRC Data Catalogue](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/71142004-19c2-4827-bfa3-16d640528e5a).

Huge thanks to my coauthors for the tireless dedication and the many discussions and insights :) [Click here](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/71142004-19c2-4827-bfa3-16d640528e5a) for the (open access) article, including maps and many more details!
