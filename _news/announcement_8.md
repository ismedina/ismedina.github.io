Our paper <i>An Updated Simplified Energy Yield Model for Recent Photovoltaic Module Technologies</i>, by Anatoli Chatzipanagi, Nigel Taylor, Ana M. Martinez, Teodora S. Lyubenova, Ewan Dunlop and me [has just been published!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3926)

In this paper we update [PVGIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/)' performance model to reflect the huge improvements that PV technologies have experience in the last 14 years. The main takeaways are that current PV modules feature a consistenly lower temperature coefficient and better low light performance. As a result, energy yield is typically increased. Integrating our results in PV simulations will reflect more accurately the improved performance of current and future PV technologies.
